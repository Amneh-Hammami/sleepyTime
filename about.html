 <p id="first"> It takes, on average, about 90 minutes to go through each cycle.<br> If you can complete five cycles a night, youâ€™d get 7.5 hours of sleep a night.<br> Six full cycles is about 9 hours of sleep.

Ideally, you want to wake up at the end of a sleep cycle instead of in the middle of it.<br> You usually feel more refreshed and energized if you wake up at the end of a sleep cycle.

 	<br>N1 (formerly stage 1):<br> This is the first stage of sleep, and is the period between being awake and falling asleep.<br>
N2 (formerly stage 2):<br> The onset of sleep begins at this stage as you become unaware of your surroundings. Your body temperature drops slightly, and your breathing and heart rate become regular.<br>
N3 (formerly stages 3 and 4): <br>This is the deepest and most restorative sleep stage during which breathing slows, blood pressure drops, muscles relax, hormones are released, healing occurs, and your body becomes re-energized.<br>
REM:<br> This is the final stage in the sleep cycle. It takes up about 25 percent of your sleep cycle. This is when your brain is most active and dreams occur.<br> During this stage, your eyes move back and forth rapidly under your eyelids.<br> REM sleep helps boost your mental and physical performance when you wake up.<br>
